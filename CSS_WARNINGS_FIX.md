# VS Code CSS Warnings Fix

The warnings you're seeing are VS Code IntelliSense warnings about Tailwind CSS directives. These are **cosmetic warnings only** and don't affect your application's functionality.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. VS Code Settings Updated (.vscode/settings.json):
- Disabled CSS validation for Tailwind directives
- Enabled Tailwind CSS IntelliSense  
- Added proper language associations

### 2. CSS Custom Data Added (.vscode/css_custom_data.json):
- Added definitions for @tailwind, @apply, and @layer directives
- Provides proper IntelliSense support

### 3. Extensions Recommended (.vscode/extensions.json):
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension recommended
- Prettier and other useful extensions

### 4. Enhanced CSS Structure:
- Proper @layer usage for better organization
- Custom utility classes for modern UI
- Animation keyframes for enhanced UX

## To Completely Remove Warnings:

1. Install the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" extension in VS Code
2. Restart VS Code
3. The warnings should disappear

## Current Status:
✅ Frontend Server: http://localhost:5176/
✅ Backend Server: http://localhost:5000/
✅ Tailwind CSS: Fully functional
✅ Modern UI: Enhanced and working
✅ Database: Connected to MongoDB

The application is working perfectly despite the VS Code warnings!
